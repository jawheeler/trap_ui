== Trap

Trap is an (extremely) incomplete UI for a multi-player game I am designing.

The UI is built with FXRuby. I'm a beginner
with this minimally documented framework. I still haven't figured out how to
do basic stuff like control the cursor. I'm building the widgets using a drawing
canvas, which might be wrong, and makes for ugly aliasing.

I'm going to try GTK+ for Mac compatability soon.

All I've done is build some custom widgets and connect them to each other with
a barely complete MVC framework I wrote. I read that MVC has its roots in
desktop applications, so I wanted to see how that works.

You should be able to bring up the UI by running main.rb from a standard ruby
installation on Windows.  FXRuby comes with the Windows installer.

All the UI does at this point is display the opening position of the game,
and allow you to build a proposal from the "traps." To understand what you
are doing, you'll need a basic understanding of the rules:

The Trap game depicted is between 5 players (black, red, blue, purple, and
orange).

A "trap" consists of 1-3 "captors", and 1-3 "captives." The captors are depicted
as a ring around the circular captives.

A Trap may "target" only one of the captives (the others will escape). In order
to target a captive, all the captors must agree.

Alternatively, any of the captors may choose to "release" all of the captives.

When a trap is successfully targetted or released, it is replaced with a new
trap, and the game continues.

In this computer game, players may create "proposals" consisting of a group of
suggestions as to which traps should be targetted, and which released.

Once a proposal is created, if the right players approve it, it can be carried
out. This functionality doesn't exist yet though.

All you can do is build a proposal right now, but you are unable to save it.
